# Contact Manager (In Progress..)

Welcome! This is an open-source **Contact Management System** built using C++, Drogon (web framework), MySQL, and Next.js for the frontend. It's still under active development and you're invited to contribute or follow along.

---

## Objectives

The goal of this project is to learn and apply following data structures as much as possible:

- Sequential Containers (Arrays, vectors, linked lists, and other linear sturctures)
- Stacks, Queues, and Priority Queue (LIFO/FIFO)
- Binary Tree with Recursion or other loops
- Sets and Maps (Hash Maps)
- Sorting Algorithms
- Self-Balancing Search Trees (AVL, Red Black Trees)
- Graph (DFS, BFS, etc.)

Note: Not all of these structures may not naturally git into final application, but the goal is to try to incorporate them thoughtfully wherever possible to maximize learning and experience.

## 🛠️ Current Status

- [x] Project setup
- [x] Frontend UI with Next.js + Tailwind (Partially)
- [ ] Backend server initialized with Drogon
- [ ] Contact model and controller
- [ ] API routes for Add, View, Delete
- [ ] MySQL integration
